        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>After I decided to leave college due to not knowing exactly what I wanted to do as a career, I experimented in many different professions. I took a factory job right after leaving college; but I knew that this kind of career was not for me. I then got into a sales position and excelled in this career. However, I ultimately decided that I wanted a career where I can do something I enjoy day in and day out while also not having my income be dependent on whether or not I was making sales. Working on commission pay leads to high levels of anxiety and stress; which is not something I want for my career and life.</p>
        <p>This life journey has led me to where I am today; starting my journey to become a professional web developer! This is the career I landed on for many reasons. Ever since I was a child I have been fascinated by all things tech; so I knew I wanted a career in the tech industry. Now that I had the industry narrowed down all that was left was to find the career that was right for me. This part of my career journey had me stumped for awhile; there are just so many different careers in the tech industry that it was a little overwhelming. After weeks of contemplating I remembered something; in high school I took a computer science class and we had a module dedicated to coding! I remember having a ton of fun during this module and being amazed at what code can do. </p>
        <p>This memory discovery is the reason that I have decided to enroll at Thinkful to become a software engineer and start the career of my dreams! I can't wait to start working with other developers on big projects and to start writing code that helps people all over the world.</p>
